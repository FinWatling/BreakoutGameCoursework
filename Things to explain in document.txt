changing the update rate of the game so that it looks smooth on higher refresh rate monitors

changing the css to make the game look more simplistic and clean

Hello Fin,

 

Your report is good. Below are my comments for improvement (ordered by importance).

 

1) Get a template (look for thesis template, or ask me if you can't find one).
Using a good template automatically takes care of the presentation (word alignment, figure arrangement, etc) and makes your report look professional. It also demonstrates that the author cares deeply about their work.
This is worth 10% alone.

 
2) Restructuring the report to match the marking criteria.
By having a section for each marking criteria, it helps Roger to "award" you mark quicker and easier.
(He doesn't need to look for it, which he may miss).

 For example, one section for introduction, one section for data types, one section for testing, one section 
for implementation, etc.

 
3) Add a "Reflection" section at the end (what we have learned after doing this project, what could have been done better). Not many students have this.

 
4) Add more screenshots of your game. Don't assume that Roger will run it (it's unlikely, too many students).
The report should be self-contained.

 
5) Add a reference section at the end.

 
6) Some texts inside the screenshots are too small.

 
7) All figures must have caption to explain what is it about, and be referred to within the text (see an attached example below).
