Mediaplayer vs AudioClip and the challenges i overcame to implement sound to the game
talk about latency and why it's an issue in a game

using java paths to get files imported

Mouse movement and how i implemented it, purely using research i found online 
--> includes type casting to int

inheritence demonstrated by the PersistentGameObj class/objects
objlives + colour changes etc

changing the update rate of the game so that it looks smooth on higher refresh rate monitors

preventing the bat from going off the screen

changing the css to make the game look more simplistic and clean
